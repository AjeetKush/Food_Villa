NPM


npm, or Node Package Manager, is a package manager for JavaScript. It is the default package manager for the Node.js runtime environment, and it plays a crucial role in managing and distributing packages (or libraries) of JavaScript code. npm is widely used in both front-end and back-end development to simplify the process of installing, managing, and updating libraries and tools.




package.json is a configuration for NPM, package.json maintain versions of our dependencies, not exact versions it can have ~ or ^ but  package-lock.json maintains the exact version of the various packages/dependencies and their transitive dependencies.

NOTE :- packages ko hi dependencies bolte hai... beacause in packages pe hi apna project dependent hai..





Normal Dependencies vs DevDependencies :-


Normal Dependencies


Normal dependencies, listed in the dependencies section of the package.json file, are packages that are required for the application to run in a production environment. These are the libraries and modules that the application needs to function correctly when deployed.




DevDependencies:


DevDependencies are packages that are only required during development and testing but are not needed for the production runtime. These dependencies typically include testing frameworks, build tools, linters, and other tools that aid in the development process.

The node_modules directory is a default directory created in Node.js projects that serves as a location for storing the project's dependenciesâ€”external libraries or modules that the project depends on.


When you use npm (Node Package Manager) or another package manager to install packages, the downloaded packages are placed in the node_modules directory.


So, node_modules is kindof like a database where all of our packages/dependencies that exist in our project.

NOTE: - package.json is the configuration of packages/dependencies for the npm, node modules is kindof data base where all of our packages/dependencies that exist in our project.


................We will install parcel-bundler as DevDependencie because it will do chunking, and
minification..etc during the development phase. 


npm install -D parcel


NPM will install the parcel as dev-dependency { that is why we gave -D }, not as normal dependency which is used in production.




..............

Caret (^) Operator   vs    Tilde (~) Operator




..............




package.json.     vs    package-lock.json


..............


node modules




Transitive dependencies


When a project has dependencies, and those dependencies, in turn, have their own dependencies, the latter are considered transitive dependencies.


Ex:- Our project has package.json which shows parcel is our dependency and this parcel can itself be dependent on so many other things because parcel needs help of so many other packages to do it work... so this is called transitive dependencies.


.................


We donot put node modules on production/github because it is super heavy{ takes a lot of space }, rather we use package.json and package-lock.json to regenerate all the node modules because it contains exact versions of various packages/dependencies. So, always put package.json and package-lock.json on github/production.


..................


To install Packages we use npm install.... commands but when you want to execute a package you write npx package_name  ......etc




npx parcel index.html


Here we executed parcel(bundler) package. So, basically when we do npx parcel index.html, index.html is source and what parcel does is it goes to index.html and build a development build for our app and it host development built to localhost:1234


..................


Why cdn links are not a good way to bring react.js in your project?




Relying on CDN links for React.js in production poses risks like network dependency, lack of version control, potential security issues, and limited customization. Local hosting through package managers and build processes provides better control, offline access, security, and optimization for modern JavaScript applications.


...................


what all things parcel is doing for us? { Parcel is a BEAST.}


- created a Dev build for us.
- created local server for us / host our app's Dev build onto that server.
- HMR - Hot Module Replacement => the changes we make it get reflected on the local server immediately.
- How Parcel do HMR? It uses File Watching Algorithm - which is written in C++. So, basically Parcel keeps eye / track on each and every file as soon as there is some change in our code parcel builds it once again.
- Faster Builds =  Because it is caching everything you do.
- Image Optimization


- If we make production Built, it will :-
         -  minify our code.
         -  Bundling.
         -  Compress Files.


- Consistent Hashing { read more about it, not that imp. }
- Code Spitting
- Differential Bundling - To support older browsers.
- Diagnostics = If you make an error in your code or configuration, Parcel displays beautiful diagnostics in your terminal and in the browser.


Every error includes a syntax highlighted code frame pointing to the exact location where the error occurred, along with hints about how to fix the issue.


Many diagnostics even include a documentation link where you can learn more.


- We can use it for HTTPS also.
   Parcel includes a development server out of the box. Just run parcel index.html to get started.


                   http://localhost:1234


   Need HTTPS? Run Parcel with the --https flag, and it will automatically generate a certificate for you! Or, if you like, you can provide your own.


   Parcel also has a built-in API proxy, which can help simulate your production environment.


   - Tree Shaking
Parcel supports tree-shaking both ES modules and CommonJS out of the box! It statically analyzes the imports and exports of each module, and removes everything that isn't used.


Tree shaking even works across dynamic import() boundaries, shared bundles, and even across languages! If you use CSS modules, unused classes will be removed automatically.


- Different build for Dev and Production.


  - Dev build = npx parcel index.html
  - Production build = npx parcel build index.html




NOTE - React app is not just having react in the project rather react uses a lot of other libaries, packages, dependencies to make our project a large scale Production Ready application.
