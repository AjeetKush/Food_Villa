      //  now let us put hello world inside this heading.
       heading.innerHTML = "Hello World from javascript!";

       // now we have to put our heading inside the root using javascript. so first of all we will find where is my root.

       const root = document.getElementById("root"); // we got the root. So, basically this root variable got the reference to the div tag which has id as root.

       // now we have to put this heading inside the div tag which has id as root. how we will do that? there is a function inside javascript which is known as append child.

       root.appendChild(heading); // heading will go as a child inside the root.
